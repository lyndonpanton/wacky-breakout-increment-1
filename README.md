# wacky-breakout-increment-1
An optional project of the "C# Class Development" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera

## Description

Project Description

You've decided to build a wacky version of the classic arcade game Breakout (we'll call it Wacky Breakout), with the following major differences:

    The game will spawn an additional ball periodically, so you’ll generally have multiple balls in play at any given time  

    Balls will have a specific lifetime, after which they’ll disappear

    There will be several different block types, including blocks that are essentially effect activators

    You’ll have a menu system that includes a main menu to select between play, help, and quitting the game; a difficulty menu to select difficulty; a help menu to describe the controls and rules to the player; and a pause menu.
    
Implementation Steps

Specifically, your solution needs to:

    Let the player move the paddle horizontally using the left (to move left!) and right keys. The paddle shouldn't leave the playfield. It's fine if the A and D keys also move the paddle left and right

    Let the player hit the ball with the paddle, aiming the ball using the contact point with the paddle

Using Different Controls

You might think that the controls I've selected for the game (left/right to move the paddle) should be different controls instead. You might also think you should implement different controls you like better in your solution. Feel free to use whatever controls you prefer.

Testing Your Game

Here are some rubrics you can use to confirm that the game functions correctly:

1. Paddle moves left and right based on left and right key input

2. Paddle is clamped to stay in playfield

3. Ball bounces off paddle at an angle based on where the ball hit the paddle
